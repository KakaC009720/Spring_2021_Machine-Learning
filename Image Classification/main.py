# **Homework 3 - Convolutional Neural Network**

This is the example code of homework 3 of the machine learning course by Prof. Hung-yi Lee.

In this homework, you are required to build a convolutional neural network for image classification, possibly with some advanced training tips.


There are three levels here:

**Easy**: Build a simple convolutional neural network as the baseline. (2 pts)

**Medium**: Design a better architecture or adopt different data augmentations to improve the performance. (2 pts)

**Hard**: Utilize provided unlabeled data to obtain better results. (2 pts)

## **About the Dataset**

The dataset used here is food-11, a collection of food images in 11 classes.

For the requirement in the homework, TAs slightly modified the data.
Please DO NOT access the original fully-labeled training data or testing labels.

Also, the modified dataset is for this course only, and any further distribution or commercial use is forbidden.

Torchvision provides lots of useful utilities for image preprocessing, data wrapping as well as data augmentation.

Here, since our data are stored in folders by class labels, we can directly apply **torchvision.datasets.DatasetFolder** for wrapping data without much effort.

Please refer to [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for details about different transforms.

"""## **Model**

The basic model here is simply a stack of convolutional layers followed by some fully-connected layers.

Since there are three channels for a color image (RGB), the input channels of the network must be three.
In each convolutional layer, typically the channels of inputs grow, while the height and width shrink (or remain unchanged, according to some hyperparameters like stride and padding).

Before fed into fully-connected layers, the feature map must be flattened into a single one-dimensional vector (for each image).
These features are then transformed by the fully-connected layers, and finally, we obtain the "logits" for each class.

### **WARNING -- You Must Know**
You are free to modify the model architecture here for further improvement.
However, if you want to use some well-known architectures such as ResNet50, please make sure **NOT** to load the pre-trained weights.
Using such pre-trained models is considered cheating and therefore you will be punished.
Similarly, it is your responsibility to make sure no pre-trained weights are used if you use **torch.hub** to load any modules.

For example, if you use ResNet-18 as your model:

model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=**False**) → This is fine.

model = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=**True**)  → This is **NOT** allowed.

You can finish supervised learning by simply running the provided code without any modification.

The function "get_pseudo_labels" is used for semi-supervised learning.
It is expected to get better performance if you use unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.
However, you have to implement the function on your own and need to adjust several hyperparameters manually.

For more details about semi-supervised learning, please refer to [Prof. Lee's slides](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses/ML_2016/Lecture/semi%20(v3).pdf).

Cheating includes but not limited to:
1.   using testing labels,
2.   submitting results to previous Kaggle competitions,
3.   sharing predictions with others,
4.   copying codes from any creatures on Earth,
5.   asking other people to do it for you.

Any violations bring you punishments from getting a discount on the final grade to failing the course.

It is your responsibility to check whether your code violates the rules.
When citing codes from the Internet, you should know what these codes exactly do.
You will **NOT** be tolerated if you break the rule and claim you don't know what these codes do.
